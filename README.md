# clrs-practice
The idea is to recreate some of the algorithms in CLRS to brush up on my algorithms and data
structures knowledge.

The language probably does not matter much, but I plan to use go, python and probably C++.  I
suspect this is going to be a long process, so I'm planning on doing each section in all three
languages, then moving on to the next one, etc.
